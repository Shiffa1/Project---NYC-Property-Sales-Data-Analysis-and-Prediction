# Project---NYC-Property-Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction

The dataset under consideration is NYC (New York City) Property Sales Data which is a Real Estate Business data. This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.

As part of the project, predictive modelling can be performed on the dataset after proper implementation of Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis and other pre-processing and Data Aggregation approaches. An integral analysis of the dataset will be done to discover New York Cityâ€™s real estate by looking at a year's worth of raw transaction records.

The predictive analytics is expected to spot trends in the market which aids to build a Regression Model that predicts sales value in the future.
